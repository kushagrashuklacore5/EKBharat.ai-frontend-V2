              Most organisations don’t need another chatbot. They need AI that connects to their data and systems, follows their rules, and does useful work
              inside real processes.

            <p>
              Ek भारत.AI is a hybrid AI-as-a-Service company. Developers and teams can use our platform — Workflow Studio, agents, multi-model orchestration and
              partner-powered GPU Cloud — to build for themselves. Businesses that prefer a complete solution can engage our team to design, build, deploy and
              maintain it.
